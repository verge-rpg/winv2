Description:

Zeux, our poor Smiley Standard Hero (r), has just defeated the Evil Wizard (tm),
and was enjoying a quiet endgame... when the beam came from the skies and
striked him (or her). When the beam cleared out, nothing was left from poor
Zeux.

Zeux woke up to find himself in a strange, colorful land. Everything looked
round and neat; even himself was fit with hands and feet. On the distance,
a great tower loomed. It was his only clue, and so began his trek...

WELCOME TO IMAGIWORLD! GOOD LUCK -- YOU'LL NEED IT...

ITEMS
-----------------------------------------------------------
These are some of the items that Zeux will find on his journey:

COINS - Standard Item That Gives One Life For Each Hundred Collected(tm).

GEMS - These are used as currency in certain parts of Imagiworld. You can use
       them to buy things in Pit Stops.

POUCHES - Give some coins and gems to you, all in a handy pack!

HEARTS - Red hearts heal one damage level! But Blue hearts heal two, and are
         stored on your inventory for later use!

LIVES - These spinning orbs give Zeux another try on his quest! Neat, huh? ...

POTIONS - Launch a spell. Whee!

SIGNS - Signs are a common view in this land. White signs must be touched.
        Blue signs are informative: Red and red-edged signs give you hints
        on Zeux's surroundings.

DOORS - Zeux can only enter opened doors. Press UP to enter a door.

INVENTORY ITEMS
-----------------------------------------------------------
These items are stored in the inventory area. Pause the game and press ALT
to activate them.

KEYS - Keys are used to open certain doors. They vanish from your inventory
       if you go to another level, but will stay there if you die and restart!
       Keys will be used automatically if you have them when touching the
       keyhole of a door. If you need space for other items, dump the key by
       using it away from a door.

SPELLBOOKS - Activate certain spells. Use them wisely.

RINGS - Activate a random spell. Or not.

SWORD - Press ALT to smite thine enemies! You lose a sword when you finish the
        stage, or when you are hit.

SCEPTER - Press ALT to shoot fireballs. You lose a scepter when you finish the
          stage, or when you are hit.

ENEMIES
-----------------------------------------------------------
Zeux'll find several enemies on the lands of Imagiworld. They're strange,
annoying, and usually can be defeated by the Standard Sidescroller Method:
Jumping on their heads. Hey, if somebody jumped on YOUR head, you'd be
defeated too.

BOSSES
-----------------------------------------------------------
Bosses command the normal enemies for the reason that they can stand more
jumps on their heads. They usually hide deeply within a castle and laugh at
your attempts to reach them. Don't worry, though: If Zeux's defeated by one,
you can call a...

REMATCH
-----------------------------------------------------------
Whenever Zeux loses a fight against a boss, if he (or she) reenters the area
immediately, he (or she) will go straight to the boss area. If you quit the
game in disgust, though, and then restart, this won't work. Serves you right.

AUTO SAVE/LOAD
-----------------------------------------------------------
The game will save your progress whenever you enter/leave a stage. Your gems,
inventory, stages completed and all that fun stuff are saved. Your coins and
lives aren't, though. Hmph.

An interesting side effect is that your game refuses to save inside...

DYSTOPIA
-----------------------------------------------------------
Zeux's main objective is to find his way out of the insane world that
surrounds him. To get out, though, he'll have to make his way through one of
the strangest structures of all time... the Tower of Dystopia.

The Tower has several entrances and exits; Zeux may have to work through
several areas just to get up one story, or he may have to occasionally climb
down. Don't worry, though: Eventually, Zeux's journey will take him (or her)
where he wants.

Who created the Tower, anyway... and who brought you here? So many questions...

CASTLES AND FLAG BOXES
-----------------------------------------------------------
Several castles are spread around the world map. Zeux might have to pass through
some to go on, while others are a simple distraction. Remember, Zeux's not there
to defeat all evil or something equally noble: He (or she) wants to get out of
this crazy land.

However, defeating a castle that doesn't lead anywhere may gain you a Rainbow
Gem! Rainbow Gems give the user magical powers, among them:

   * Magic Affinity: Magic spells last longer;
   * Flag Power: Flag Boxes of the gem's color turn on, and give prizes;
   * Gem-O-Vision: Ability to see hidden blocks!

   Could there be other powers?
